Service Rep: How may I assist you today?
Customer: I need to change the shipping address for an order.
Service Rep: Unfortunately, if the order has already been shipped, there's nothing I can do. If it hasn't been fulfilled yet, I can help. Do you have the order ID?
Customer: Yes, it's 88986367.
Service Rep: One moment, I'll check your order.
Customer: Ugh, okay.
Service Rep: It looks like your order was shipped 2 days ago and is now with the shipping provider. You'll need to contact them to update the delivery details. Here's the link to track your order: [shipping provider link].
Customer: Seriously? This is so frustrating.
Service Rep: I understand, but unfortunately, there's nothing more I can do at this point.
Customer: That's really disappointing.
Service Rep: Is there anything else I can help you with?
Customer: No, thanks.
